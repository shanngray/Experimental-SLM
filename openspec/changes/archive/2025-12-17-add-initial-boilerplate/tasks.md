## 1. Project Structure
- [x] 1.1 Create modular folder structure:
  - [x] src/ - Source code modules
  - [x] tests/ - Test files
  - [x] configs/ - YAML configuration files
  - [x] data/ - Dataset storage
  - [x] logs/ - Training logs
  - [x] checkpoints/ - Model checkpoints
- [x] 1.2 Create __init__.py files where needed for Python packages
- [x] 1.3 Create placeholder directories with .gitkeep files

## 2. Package Management
- [x] 2.1 Configure uv as package manager
- [x] 2.2 Validate & Update pyproject.toml with project metadata
- [x] 2.3 Add PyTorch as initial dependency (add others as they become relevant)
- [x] 2.4 Set Python version requirement to 3.13

## 3. Documentation
- [x] 3.1 Create comprehensive README.md with:
  - [x] Project overview and purpose (placeholder section)
  - [x] Setup instructions (uv installation and usage) - **FOCUS AREA**
  - [x] Project structure explanation (placeholder section)
  - [x] Quick start guide (placeholder section)
  - [x] Development workflow (placeholder section)
  - [x] Architecture overview (placeholder section)

## 4. Configuration Files
- [x] 4.1 Create .gitignore for Python/PyTorch project
- [x] 4.2 Add any other standard config files (if needed)

## 5. Validation
- [x] 5.1 Verify uv can install dependencies
- [x] 5.2 Verify folder structure is correct
- [x] 5.3 Verify README.md is complete and accurate
